-If you have a StringStat(n) and n is larger than the number of characters you ever put into it, then when you try to ReturnEntropy it will divide by 0 (because N=0 since we never accumulated enough character to put a string of length n into StringStat.data).  Want to handle this in a more transparent way, either by returning entropy of 0 (and what would I return for the entropy density?), or by returning an error message.
